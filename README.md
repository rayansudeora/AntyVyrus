**Language: Python**
**Using Flask**

*A Flask project which uses web scraping to show users updated cases and deaths from any country around the world.*

## Instructions

1) Clone/Download these files

2) Open up terminal/command prompt.

3) Make sure that you have Python and Flask installed. You can install Python by typing in 'pip install python'. Also install the specific packages that are used in this project. A simple web search will lead you to instructions on downloading these packages, Flask, and Python. You can also install most packages by typing in 'pip install *package*'. 

4) Get into the directory that you downloaded this repository in using cd (here is a link on how to do that if you don't know - http://modulesunraveled.com/command-line-beginners/moving-and-out-directories-cd-command)

5) To check if you are in the correct directory, type ls and hit enter. This should show you all the files that are inside the current folder you are in. If you are in the correct directory, you should see the file: website.py.

6) Finally, type in "python website.py" , and click enter.

7) The command prompt will show a link. Simply copy paste that link into a browser and click enter. Then, just like that, you should see a fully functioning COVID-19 data updater!
